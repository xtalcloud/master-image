## Requirements

You must install the packer executable here: https://www.packer.io/downloads

## Building

The Packer template itself is located here at:

You can choose exactly which Enterprise Linux ISO you wish to use by selecting the appropriate variables file located in:

  ./template/vars/

On Linux:

 ./path/to/packer build -force -var-file "./template/vars/rhel/x86_64/8.3.json" ./template/template.json

On Windows:

 .\path\to\packer build -force -var-file ".\template\vars\rhel\x86_64\8.3.json" .\template\template.json
